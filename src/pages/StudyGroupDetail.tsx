                            I designed this concept app to bring together students, hobbyists, and lifelong learners who are passionate about studying and self-improvement.
                            The goal was to create a simple and intuitive platform where users can easily find or propose topics of interest - from design and programming to music and more - and connect
                            with like-minded people to form study groups, both remotely and in person. The clean and minimal design ensures a seamless user experience, making it easy to explore subjects, join discussions, or start new ones.

                            Despite the abundance of online courses and learning content, it's often difficult to find people with similar interests or goals to share the journey with.
                            Traditional platforms offer either rigid class structures or passive content consumption - but lack tools to facilitate real, spontaneous peer-to-peer collaboration.
                            This gap creates frustration, drop-off, and a sense of isolation among learners.

                            Throughout the design process, several user and product challenges emerged that shaped core design decisions. Some of the most critical included:<br /><br />
                            <BoldSpan>Designing for two very different user types:</BoldSpan><br />While Joseph expects speed and efficiency, July needs simplicity and guidance.<br />
                            The solution was a dual-layered UX: minimal friction for experienced users and contextual help + onboarding for new users - without compromising the interface simplicity.<br />
                            <BoldSpan>Reducing the "tool fatigue" of existing platforms:</BoldSpan><br />Interviews and research showed that users were tired of complex, noisy platforms (like Discord or Meetup).<br />
                            I prioritized a clean visual hierarchy, with immediate access to relevant actions (search, join, chat) and low cognitive load per screen.<br />
                            <BoldSpan>Encouraging first interaction in group chats:</BoldSpan><br />One pain point was the hesitation to send the first message.<br />
                            I introduced "intro prompts" and optional first-message templates to lower social friction and improve engagement.<br />
                            <BoldSpan>Balancing flexibility with structure in group creation:</BoldSpan><br />Users wanted both spontaneous and recurring group formats.<br /><br />
                            The app flow supports creating one-time events or ongoing study groups, with minimal steps and topic-based discovery.

                            Although this project was primarily a <BoldSpan>UX/UI concept</BoldSpan>, I defined the design system and interface behaviors with development in mind.
                            I structured components for easy handoff via <BoldSpan>Figma</BoldSpan>, with attention to <BoldSpan>responsiveness, accessibility (WCAG), and UI consistency</BoldSpan>.
                            The prototype could be implemented using modern frameworks like <BoldSpan>React Native</BoldSpan> or <BoldSpan>Flutter</BoldSpan> to support both mobile and web platforms.
                            All screens were built considering flexible layout constraints, and transitions were designed using Framer principles to ensure smooth user interaction.
                            I also explored how to scale features progressively in case of future MVP development, prioritizing core features such as "group creation" and "topic matchmaking."

                            Usability testing was conducted on early wireframes and interactive prototypes using simulated sessions with fictional users like Joseph and July.
                            I performed 3 informal walkthroughs and used the "think-aloud" method to observe potential points of confusion. The test results highlighted the need for:<br /><br />
                            - <BoldSpan>Simplified navigation labels</BoldSpan><br />
                            - <BoldSpan>Shorter flows to reach group discovery</BoldSpan><br />
                            - <BoldSpan>A clearer onboarding step for first-time users</BoldSpan><br /><br />
                            Based on these insights, I refined the user flow and added visual cues (empty states, hints, and helper icons).
                            If released, I would plan a soft launch with iterative A/B testing and feedback collection via in-app surveys.

                            This project allowed me to explore a solution that balances social connection with focused study environments, tailored to both tech-savvy and non-tech users.
                            The biggest challenge was designing a universal entry point that doesn't intimidate users like July while satisfying Joseph's need for speed and efficiency.
                            I followed a user-centered, problem-first approach with measurable improvements along the way.
                            If further developed, I would explore community moderation tools and smart matching algorithms to foster healthier interactions.
                            Overall, this concept demonstrates my ability to combine strategic UX thinking with real-world usability needs across different user types.
